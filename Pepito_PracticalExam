You'll know it's a GE class when no one seems to be talking to each other on the first day.

Me as I go through everyday life: 
"Don't say your real thoughts, don't say your real thoughts." 
Y'all are asking what my thesis topic would be when I can't even decide what I want to eat for lunch. 
Constantly in a cycle of "Ugh, library work is mundane" to "Holy crap, this is awesome."

Maybe not at your launch date but definitely someday. 
Okay, I promised to watch an episode of Steins;Gate because it's been in my HD for years and now I'm almost done watching.

ASSESSMENT  
  Just when I thought that I had learned nearly every kind of work used in the Digital Humanities, the field continues to prove
itself as forward-looking and innovative. Tonight, I have learned about Sentiments Analysis, a topic that I have never even 
before. As it turns out, what was presented in our first weeks of DH was only a miniscule amount of the seemingly endless
possibilities provided by the Digital Humanities.

  I discovered that SA (Sentiments Analysis) is a method to measure the attitudes and opinions expressed by a person or a group 
in their text. Upon hearing this, I immediately imagined the different ways this can be used and how this is not really that
well-known but our professor discussed that this has already been used by many companies to analyse the reception of their
product. Aside from its commercial use, I can also think of other ways to use this. For example, determining the general opinion
of the public about a certain issue which we already did through an application.

  But for our activity for today, we were tasked to look a bit deeper into our psyche and use the same tool to analyse our words,
either on our writings or our social media correspondences. I have to admit I was a bit afraid to discover what the results might
show. We used a website namely "https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/" to do our sentiments analysis. We would use the tidy 
data principle. I have decided to use my twitter posts as my text source as I am interested to know what most of my writings 
are about when I'm mindlessly tweeting. I collected all of my tweets for the last two months and made it as an input for the 
analysis. The results were a bit surprising.
 
  The data showed by the site says that my tweets are mostly a combination of joy-filled messages and those that express sadness. 
I didn't expect that that would be the outcome. It seems like I'm learning a lot about myself. Not only that, I have also 
discovered that most of my tweets are tentative which means that my writings almost express uncertainty and doubt. It was then
that I noticed I do use a lot of questions in my tweets. My social tendency appears to be agreeableness. According to the site, 
this means that I am cooperative with others which I have to admit is true.
 
  Looking back to the activity, it is surprising to discover new ways that the humanities and information technologies intersect.
Our discussions do reflect real-life scenarios. This is another example of how big the possibilities are and how grand the results
would be when the two intersect. It is only through collaboration that methods such as the Sentiments Analysis we just did would 
be applicable. I cannot wait for more opportunities with Digital Humanities!
